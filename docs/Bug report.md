Additional comments:
- Test number 3  is due to the way floating point numbers are stored in the computer. The fix for this is, for now to use a python library that handles this problem. We also use a margin of error 'EPSILON' to counteract this error. If we deem necessary in the future, we can implement our own solution but for now it is not a priority.
