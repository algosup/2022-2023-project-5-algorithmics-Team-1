## **Description**

Krug Grande cuvée is a combination of 250 wines of the year plus 150 “reserve” wines from the past 14 years. The Cellar Master, Julie CAVIL, and her team will taste different combinations for about 9 months until they find the perfect formula (a bit like a perfume). Once the formula is known, becomes the challenge of blending large quantities of wine in the right proportions. 
We have at your disposal 330 tanks of various sizes (that we can reuse several times in the process) and a system of pumps and pipes that can connect any tank with any other tank. 
VERY IMPORTANT: due to oxidation, tanks should never be left partially full, they are either completely full or completely empty, making sure the wine is never in contact with oxygen. 
 
Our goal is to produce the closest result to the formula with the minimum number of step
